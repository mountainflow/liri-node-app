# LIRI Bot

## Search for concerts, songs, and movies!

Liri is a CLI app that uses the Bands In Town API, Spotify, and OMDB to search for your favorite media.

Use these commands for it to work:

* **node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>**
    * Get upcoming concert information from Bands In Town
* **node liri.js spotify-this-song `<song name here>`**
    * Get information on any song
* **node liri.js movie-this <movie name here>**
    * Get information on any movie
* **node liri.js do-what-it-says**
    * Gives random info

## Here's a quick video on how it works:
